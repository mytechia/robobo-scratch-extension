# Robobo Scratch Extension
Scratch extension to remotely program (or control) the Robobo educational robot (www.theroboboproject.com).

This experimental Scratch extension (for use with www.scratchx.org) allows the control (over WiFi) of a remote Robobo robot.

You can easily create programs that:
- Control the movement of the robot.
- Use its sensing capabilities  (face detection, note detection, blob detection and more).
- Make the robot interact with people (change its face, play sounds and musical noutes, speak, etc.).

More detailed instructions (in Spanish) are available at the Robobo educational robot programming manual: http://education.theroboboproject.com/manual-de-programacion

More information about the Robobo educational robot can be found at www.theroboboproject.com

The current version of the extension is https://mytechia.github.io/robobo-scratch-extension/2/robobo-scratch-extension.js. This is the URL that must be used in ScratchX.

An example project, that implementas a remote control program can be found at https://mytechia.github.io/robobo-scratch-extension/examples/remotecontrol.sbx.

The extension https://mytechia.github.io/robobo-scratch-extension/robobo-scratch-extension-lite.js is deprecated and will be removed in the near future.
